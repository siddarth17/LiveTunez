# LiveTunez

LiveTunez allows live music fans to find local concerts, enhance their concert-going experience with comprehensive setlists, and experience even more live music by easily saving them as playlists in their Spotify accounts. LiveTunez is a user-focused mobile application. Aimed at music enthusiasts and concertgoers who want to investigate live events and revisit their memories, LiveTunez provides an integrated platform that blends interactive concert/event discovery with location-based suggestions. 

The app utilizes user location with Apple's MapKit and Core Location frameworks to discover live concerts and events nearby, displaying them on an interactive home page along with their details. 
Additionally, by utilizing Spotify Web API and SetlistFM API, users can access detailed setlists for concerts to know what they will be listening to. By using OAuth 2.0, the app also allows users to log into their Spotify accounts and get the option to download concert setlists as Spotify playlists into their accounts. The app also utilizes Apple's EventKit to save the event dates to their device's calendar along with Firebase to store concerts that users save, their Spotify account details, and search history.
